CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Nigeria Rent Transparency & Affordability Checker

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

In Nigeria, many tenants struggle with renting issues such as unclear rent
breakdowns, sudden rent increases, hidden fees, and difficulty knowing whether a
rent is affordable based on their income. There is also a lack of simple tools that help
tenants understand total yearly rent costs, agent fees, caution fees, and how long it
will take to save for rent.
    This program will help tenants by:
    Calculating the true cost of renting (rent + agent fee + agreement fee + caution fee)
    Checking whether a rent is affordable based on monthly income
    Comparing different rental options
    Helping users plan how long it will take to save for rent
This tool can assist students, young workers, and families in Nigeria when making renting decisions.


3. What will you learn from developing this program?
By developing this program, I will learn how to:
    
    How to design and organize a Python program using multiple single-purpose functions
    Break a real-world problem into small, testable functions
    Perform financial calculations using Python
    Read and write data from CSV files
    Use dictionaries and lists to organize rental data
    Handle user input and errors safely
    Write automated tests using pytest
    Design a program that could realistically be expanded into a real application

4. What Python modules will your program use?
The program will use the following Python modules:
 csv
datetime
pytest
math

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)
The program will include the following functions:

read_rent_listings(filename)

calculate_total_rent_cost(annual_rent, agent_fee_rate, agreement_fee_rate, caution_fee)

calculate_monthly_savings_needed(total_cost, months)

is_rent_affordable(monthly_income, annual_rent)

compare_rent_options(rent_list)

get_current_datetime()

print_rent_report(rent_data, affordability, savings_plan, date_time)

main()


6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

The following test functions will be written using pytest:

test_calculate_total_rent_cost()

test_calculate_monthly_savings_needed()

test_is_rent_affordable()



Example of what the program could do (user experience)

Welcome to the Nigeria Rent Transparency Tool

Monthly Income: ₦150,000
Annual Rent: ₦600,000
Agent Fee: 10%
Agreement Fee: 10%
Caution Fee: ₦100,000

Total Move-in Cost: ₦820,000
Affordable: NO
Months needed to save: 6
